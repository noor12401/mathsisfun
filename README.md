# Math Is Fun
If we have two same variables or same equations on both the sides, then applying different and relevant formula on both the sides will give you different result. This twist although mathematically is correct but provides you equations which are wrong. One can not only prove ```1 = 2``` but can prove ```any number = any number```. 

# Project Demo
Project is live [See Demo](https://oneequalto.herokuapp.com/)

# What One Can Learn?
- Maths is fun!
- For Loops
- Implementing Emojis
- Implementing Superscript or any unicode
- Recursive Call for each equation

# Technologies / Libraries Used
There are teo files
- ```proven_numbers.py``` with simple python script.
- ```proven_numbers.py``` using PyWebIO Library

PyWebIO is simple library used to deploy your python application on the frontend without using Flask or Django. [See Documentation](https://pywebio.readthedocs.io/)

# How To Use?
To run ```proven_numbers without pywebio (basic).py```, simply go to your directory where the file is saved and open CMD there then enter:
- ```python <filename>.py```

To run ```prove_numbers.py``` download PyWebio first:
- ```pip install pywebio```
- Open CMD and go to directory where ```prove_numbers.py``` is saved.
- ```python prove_numbers.py```
- Now open chrome broswer and go to ```http://localhost:8080/``` to run the application.
